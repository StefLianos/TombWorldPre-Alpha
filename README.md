# TombWorldPre-Alpha

This project was inspired by [Risk of Rain](https://riskofraingame.com/) from [Hoopoo Games](http://hopoogames.com/) and was my first attempt at GameMaker and Sprite design/animation.

# How to play 

You move using **AWSD**, jump with **SPACEBAR** and fire with **LEFT SHIFT**.
Press **R** at any time to restart the game.
Press **Z** to make the window larger.

# Note

The info on the top left relates to the spawning algorithm and not your score.
